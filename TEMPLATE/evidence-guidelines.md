# Evidence Guidelines

## Do
- Tie every conclusion to at least one artifact.
- Include relevant timestamps when available.
- Keep indicators clearly listed (IPs, domains, hashes, filenames).
- Separate raw evidence from your interpretation.

## Do Not
- Do not publish flags or walkthrough answers.
- Do not copy paste the lab scenario text.
- Do not describe tool clicks; explain your reasoning.
- Do not make conclusions without supporting evidence.
